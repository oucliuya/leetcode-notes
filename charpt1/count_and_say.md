# 38. Count and Say

## 1 题目

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

1 is read off as "```one 1```" or ```11```.
11 is read off as "```two 1s```" or ```21```.
21 is read off as "```one 2```, then ```one 1```" or ```1211```.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```
